function searchlight(statmap, analysis, mask, whichsrchlght, whichsubs)

% SEARCHLIGHT(STATMAP, ANALYSIS, MASK, WHICHSRCHLGHT, WHICHSUBS) scans
% imaged brain volumes at each voxel within MASK. The searchlight is a
% spherical cube, the contents of which are analyzed via differences in
% Fisher-transformed correlations across conditions of interest. The
% difference value computed at each location is assigned to the center voxel
% of the searchlight. The resulting z-map shows how well the multivariate
% signal in the local spherical neighborhood differentiates between
% conditions of interest.
%
% SEARCHLIGHT assumes a home directory that contains a "searchlight"
% directory, which contains a "results" directory and a "masks" directory.
% In turn, "results" is assumed to contain one directory for each set of
% general linear model (GLM) maps that is analyzed. STATMAP declares the
% name of this directory within "results". The directory specified by
% STATMAP will be made to contain one directory for each radius-mask
% analysis, declared by ANALYSIS, which can take the form ['r' radius mask]
% (e.g., "r3wholebrain").
%
% Though this searchlight analysis is executed at the level of individual
% subjects (WHICHSEARCHLIGHT = 'subject'), a sample of participants can be
% analyzed as a group in a univariate random-effects analysis
% (WHICHSEARCHLIGHT = 'rfx'). At each voxel, a t-statistic is computed
% comparing the average z-score across participants against 0. The resulting
% t-map shows how well the multivariate signal in the local spherical
% neighborhood of the sample differentiates between conditions of interest.
%
% Finally, a non-searchlight multivariate analysis can be performed for one
% or many regions-of-interest (ROI) at the level of individual subjects
% (WHICHSEARCHLIGHT = 'roi'). This analysis correlates the voxels within an
% ROI instead of creating spherical searchlights at each voxel.
%
% SEARCHLIGHT is a "wrapper" script that can analyze multiple subjects
% sequentially (those declared by WHICHSUBS, a vector that specifies which
% subjects will be analyzed) should be edited from analysis to analysis. In
% turn, it calls, SEARCHLIGHTONE.m, SEARCHLIGHTRFX.m, or SEARCHLIGHTROI.m.
% These three scripts are robust across analyses and should not be modified
% in their original form, except in cases that build on their functionality.
